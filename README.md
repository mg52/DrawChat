# DrawChat

I uploaded this project on https://musdraw.herokuapp.com/
You need to open at least 2 pages to send your drawing.

To run the application locally, 

1. Download index.js, index.html, package.json into a file

2. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

3. open command window then "cd" to the application file

4. write "npm install"

5. write "node index.js"

6. go to "http://localhost:5000/"

thats it.
